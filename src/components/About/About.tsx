            Hi there! I'm Ali Nosratipour, and I love working with people and
            tackling challenges head-on. I'm great at collaborating and always
            find it easy to get along with others, which helps create a fun and
            productive team vibe. Problem-solving is my jam, and I'm always on
            the lookout for new things to learn and ways to grow. I also have a
            good grasp of the business side of things and love sharing ideas on
            how to make things better. Whether we're working on a project
            together or brainstorming fresh solutions, Iâ€™m all about achieving
            awesome results.

              I research the client's business, competitors, and customers, then
              draft an initial prototype using wireframing tools like Figma. My
              first step is to sit down with the client and ensure everything is
              covered, such as the structure of the site, user experience, and
              responsiveness across all devices.
